## Idea
The idea for this project is to make a small showcase for the photos i've taken throught my journey in the lovely world of photography
For this i wanted to make a NextJS project to serve as a double kind of portfolio, for my photos and my web dev projects.

## Time Limit
For this project i've established myself a time limit, in which i won't be able to surpass 24 hours total and the end date has to be the 20th of march.
